Books Reading Application

## Project Description

This project aims to create an application that offers a comprehensive book
reading service. The application consists of several main pages:

1. **Home Page** This page showcases a call-to-action button to start using the
   application, redirecting users to the "Recommended" page after authorization.

2. **Register Page** The Register page includes a RegisterForm and a link to the
   Login page. The RegisterForm contains inputs for Name, Email, and Password, a
   submit button for Registration, and validation using Formik and Yup.

3. **Login Page** The Login page includes a LoginForm and a link to the Register
   page. The LoginForm contains inputs for Email and Password, a submit button
   for Log In, and validation using Formik and Yup.

4. **Recommended Page** The Recommended page consists of a Dashboard panel and a
   RecommendedBooks block. The Dashboard contains filters for finding books, a
   description of the application functionality, and a static quote block. The
   RecommendedBooks block includes a page header, server-side pagination, and a
   list of recommended books.

5. **My Library Page** My Library page consists of a Dashboard panel and a
   MyLibraryBooks block. The Dashboard contains a form for adding books
   (AddBook), a list of recommended books, and a link to the Recommended page.
   The MyLibraryBooks block includes a page header, a status filter for books,
   and a list of the user's books.

6. **Reading Page** The Reading page consists of a Dashboard panel and a MyBook
   block. The Dashboard contains a form for starting or stopping reading, and
   the MyBook block includes detailed information about the book being read and
   a progress tracker.
